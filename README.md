# PS Documentation Project

## Front End
A static website hosted on Github pages acts as the front end of the tool. The website is designed using HTML and CSS and Javascript is used to interact with the Github Rest API.\
Users will interact with this front end to choose the required files from an existing templates repository.\

## Github Rest API
The API allows reading of file names and contents from a repository, as well as the creation of new repositories and files in it. The website utilises this ability to create the required files based on the user's choices and populates them with content from the existing files. \
Interactions with the API are performed using Javascript.\
